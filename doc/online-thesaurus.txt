INTRODUCTION                                                *online-thesaurus*

This plugin provides a command for looking up words in an online thesaurus,
which is at the moment configured to be http://thesaurus.com/

The plugin displays the definition of the word under the cursor and a list of
synonyms.

The credit for the original idea and code goes to Nick Coleman:

MAPPINGS                                           *online-thesaurus-mappings*

                                                 *:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord*
The plugin provides the |:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord| command to look up the
current word under the cursor in an online thesaurus.

                                                      *:OnlineThesaurusLookup*
Alternatively, you can look up any word with |:OnlineThesaurusLookup|:
>
  :OnlineThesaurusLookup word
<
Internally, both commands make a request to http://thesaurus.com/, parse the
results, and display them in a vertical split in the bottom.

By default the |:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord| command is mapped to
|<LocalLeader>K|. If you haven't remapped |<LocalLeader>|, it defaults to |\|.
To close the split, just press |q|.

CUSTOMIZATION                                 *online-thesaurus-customization*

                                                 *g:online_thesaurus_map_keys*
If you want to disable the default key binding, add the following line to your
|.vimrc|:
>
  let g:online_thesaurus_map_keys = 0
<
Then you can map the |:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord| command to anything you
want as follows:
>
  nnoremap <your key binding> :OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord<CR>
<
