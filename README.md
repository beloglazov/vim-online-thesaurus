# DEPRECATED
This plugin doesn't work anymore. Please read [this

information.

# Vim Online Thesaurus

This is a plugin for Vim allowing you to look up words in an online thesaurus,
which is at the moment configured to be http://thesaurus.com/

The plugin displays the definition of the word under the cursor and a list of
synonyms.

## Installation

If you are using Vundle, just add the following line to your .vimrc:

```
Plugin 'beloglazov/vim-online-thesaurus'
```

Then run `:PluginInstall` to install the plugin.

Note: Earlier versions required the "Bundle" keyword instead of plugin (i.e. :BundleInstall
and Bundle 'beloglazov/vim-online-thesaurus'). However,
this is deprecated and should not be used any longer.


## Usage

The plugin provides the `:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord` command to look up the
current word under the cursor in an online thesaurus. Alternatively, you can
look up any word with `:Thesaurus word`.

Internally, both commands make a request to http://thesaurus.com/, parse the
results, and display them in a vertical split in the bottom.

By default the `:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord` command is mapped to
`<LocalLeader>K`.  If you haven't remapped `<LocalLeader>`, it defaults to `\`.
To close the split, just press `q`.


## Configuration

If you want to disable the default key binding, add the following line to your
.vimrc:

```
let g:online_thesaurus_map_keys = 0
```

Then you can map the `:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord` command to anything you want
as follows:

```
nnoremap <your key binding> :OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord<CR>
```

Enjoy!
